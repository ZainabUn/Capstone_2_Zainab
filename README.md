# Capstone2
were provided with 2 files: Customer_list_updated.csv and transaction_data.csv

clean_up_list.ipynb is a jupyter notebook can take any csv file that has similar format as customer_list_updated and clean it up. It also includes analyzation of cutomer data 

cleaneduplist is the exported file after cleaning the data.


transaction analysis contains the analyzation of the csv file transaction data


some code that I just wanted to save for using later:
file = input("Enter file name:")
type= input("Enter file type")


customer_data= open(input)
print(customer_data.read(200))
customer_data.close()
